<p>GCC looks in several different places for header files to be included.
On the GNU system, and Unix systems, the default directories for
system header files are:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>libdir</var>/gcc/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var>/include
/usr/local/include
<var>libdir</var>/gcc/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var>/include-fixed
<var>libdir</var>/<var>target</var>/include
/usr/include/<var>target</var>
/usr/include
</pre></div>

<p>The list may be different in some operating systems.  Other
directories are added for C++.
</p>
<p>In the above, <var>target</var> is the canonical name of the system GCC was
configured to compile code for; often but not always the same as the
canonical name of the system it runs on.  <var>version</var> is the version
of GCC in use.
</p>
<p>You can add to this list with the <samp>-I<var>dir</var></samp> command-line
option.  All the directories named by <samp>-I</samp> are searched, in
left-to-right order, <em>before</em> the default directories.  The only
exception is when <samp>dir</samp> is already searched by default.  In
this case, the option is ignored and the search order for system
directories remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>Duplicate directories are removed from the quote and bracket search
chains before the two chains are merged to make the final search chain.
Thus, it is possible for a directory to occur twice in the final search
chain if it was specified in both the quote and bracket chains.
</p>
<p>You can prevent GCC from searching any of the default directories with
the <samp>-nostdinc</samp> option.  This is useful when you are compiling an
operating system kernel or some other program that does not use the
standard C library facilities, or the standard C library itself.
<samp>-I</samp> options are not ignored as described above when
<samp>-nostdinc</samp> is in effect.
</p>
<p>GCC looks for headers requested with <code>#include&nbsp;&quot;<var>file</var>&quot;<!-- /@w --></code>
first in the directory containing the current file, then in the
<em>quote directories</em> specified by <samp>-iquote</samp> options, then in
the same places it looks for a system header.  For example, if
<samp>/usr/include/sys/stat.h</samp> contains <code>#include&nbsp;&quot;types.h&quot;<!-- /@w --></code>,
GCC looks for <samp>types.h</samp> first in <samp>/usr/include/sys</samp>, then in
the quote directories and then in its usual search path.
</p>
<p><code>#line</code> (see <a href="Line-Control.html">Line Control</a>) does not change GCC&rsquo;s idea of the
directory containing the current file.
</p>
<span id="index-quote-directories"></span>
<p>The <samp>-I-</samp> is an old-fashioned, deprecated way to specify the
quote directories.  To look for headers in a directory named <samp>-</samp>,
specify <samp>-I./-</samp>.  There are several more ways to adjust the
header search path.  See <a data-manual="gcc" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/invocation.html#invocation">Invoking GCC</a> in <cite>Using the GNU Compiler Collection</cite>.
