<p>The rest of this chapter covers advanced topics about structures.  If
you are just learning C, you can skip it.
</p>
<p>The precise layout of a <code>struct</code> type is crucial when using it to
overlay hardware registers, to access data structures in shared
memory, or to assemble and disassemble packets for network
communication.  It is also important for avoiding memory waste when
the program makes many objects of that type.  However, the layout
depends on the target platform.  Each platform has conventions for
structure layout, which compilers need to follow.
</p>
<p>Here are the conventions used on most platforms.
</p>
<p>The structure&rsquo;s fields appear in the structure layout in the order
they are declared.  When possible, consecutive fields occupy
consecutive bytes within the structure.  However, if a field&rsquo;s type
demands more alignment than it would get that way, C gives it the
alignment it requires by leaving a gap after the previous field.
</p>
<p>Once all the fields have been laid out, it is possible to determine
the structure&rsquo;s alignment and size.  The structure&rsquo;s alignment is the
maximum alignment of any of the fields in it.  Then the structure&rsquo;s
size is rounded up to a multiple of its alignment.  That may require
leaving a gap at the end of the structure.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples, where we assume that <code>char</code> has size and
alignment 1 (always true), and <code>int</code> has size and alignment 4
(true on most kinds of computers):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct foo
{
  char a, b;
  int c;
};
</pre></div>

<p>This structure occupies 8 bytes, with an alignment of 4.  <code>a</code> is
at offset 0, <code>b</code> is at offset 1, and <code>c</code> is at offset 4.
There is a gap of 2 bytes before <code>c</code>.
</p>
<p>Contrast that with this structure:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct foo
{
  char a;
  int c;
  char b;
};
</pre></div>

<p>This structure has size 12 and alignment 4.  <code>a</code> is at offset 0,
<code>c</code> is at offset 4, and <code>b</code> is at offset 8.  There are two
gaps: three bytes before <code>c</code>, and three bytes at the end.
</p>
<p>These two structures have the same contents at the C level, but one
takes 8 bytes and the other takes 12 bytes due to the ordering of the
fields.  A reliable way to avoid this sort of wastage is to order the
fields by size, biggest fields first.
