<p>Whitespace means characters that exist in a file but appear blank in a
printed listing of a file (or traditionally did appear blank, several
decades ago).  The C language requires whitespace in order to separate
two consecutive identifiers, or to separate an identifier from a
numeric constant.  Other than that, and a few special situations
described later, whitespace is optional; you can put it in when you
wish, to make the code easier to read.
</p>
<p>Space and tab in C code are treated as whitespace characters.  So are
line breaks.  You can represent a line break with the newline
character (also called <em>linefeed</em> or LF), CR (carriage return), or
the CRLF sequence (two characters: carriage return followed by a
newline character).
</p>
<p>The <em>formfeed</em> character, Control-L, was traditionally used to
divide a file into pages.  It is still used this way in source code,
and the tools that generate nice printouts of source code still start
a new page after each &ldquo;formfeed&rdquo; character.  Dividing code into
pages separated by formfeed characters is a good way to break it up
into comprehensible pieces and show other programmers where they start
and end.
</p>
<p>The <em>vertical tab</em> character, Control-K, was traditionally used to
make printing advance down to the next section of a page.  We know of
no particular reason to use it in source code, but it is still
accepted as whitespace in C.
</p>
<p>Comments are also syntactically equivalent to whitespace.
