<p>NaNs are not numbers: they represent values from computations that
produce undefined results.  They have a distinctive property that
makes them unlike any other floating-point value: they are
<em>unequal to everything, including themselves</em>!  Thus, you can
write a test for a NaN like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if (x != x)
  printf (&quot;x is a NaN\n&quot;);
</pre></div>

<p>This test works in GNU C, but some compilers might evaluate that test
expression as false without properly checking for the NaN value.
A more portable way to test for NaN is to use the <code>isnan</code>
function declared in <code>math.h</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if (isnan (x))
  printf (&quot;x is a NaN\n&quot;);
</pre></div>

<p>See <a data-manual="libc" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Floating-Point-Classes.html#Floating-Point-Classes">Floating Point Classes</a> in <cite>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>One important use of NaNs is marking of missing data.  For
example, in statistics, such data must be omitted from
computations.  Use of any particular finite value for missing
data would eventually collide with real data, whereas such data
could never be a NaN, so it is an ideal marker.  Functions that
deal with collections of data that may have holes can be written
to test for, and ignore, NaN values.
</p>
<p>It is easy to generate a NaN in computations: evaluating <code>0.0 /
0.0</code> is the commonest way, but <code>Infinity - Infinity</code>,
<code>Infinity / Infinity</code>, and <code>sqrt (-1.0)</code> also work.
Functions that receive out-of-bounds arguments can choose to return a
stored NaN value, such as with the <code>NAN</code> macro defined in
<code>math.h</code>, but that does not set the <em>invalid operand</em>
exception flag, and that can fool some programs.
</p>
<span id="index-NaNs_002dalways_002dpropagate-rule"></span>
<p>Like Infinity, NaNs propagate in computations, but they are even
stickier, because they never disappear in division. Thus, once a
NaN appears in a chain of numerical operations, it is almost
certain to pop out into the final results.  The programmer
has to decide whether that is expected, or whether there is a
coding or algorithmic error that needs repair.
</p>
<p>In general, when function gets a NaN argument, it usually returns a
NaN.  However, there are some exceptions in the math-library functions
that you need to be aware of, because they violate the
<em>NaNs-always-propagate</em> rule:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>pow (x, 0.0)</code> always returns <code>1.0</code>, even if <code>x</code> is
0.0, Infinity, or a NaN.

</li><li> <code>pow (1, y)</code> always returns <code>1</code>, even if <code>y</code> is a NaN.

</li><li> <code>hypot (INFINITY, y)</code> and <code>hypot (-INFINITY, y)</code> both
always return <code>INFINITY</code>, even if <code>y</code> is a Nan.

</li><li> If just one of the arguments to <code>fmax (x, y)</code> or
<code>fmin (x, y)</code> is a NaN, it returns the other argument.  If
both arguments are NaNs, it returns a NaN, but there is no
requirement about where it comes from: it could be <code>x</code>, or
<code>y</code>, or some other quiet NaN.
</li></ul>

<p>NaNs are also used for the return values of math-library
functions where the result is not representable in real
arithmetic, or is mathematically undefined or uncertain, such as
<code>sqrt (-1.0)</code> and <code>sin (Infinity)</code>.  However, note that a
result that is merely too big to represent should always produce
an Infinity, such as with <code>exp (1000.0)</code> (too big) and
<code>exp (Infinity)</code> (truly infinite).
