<span id="index-complex-arithmetic-in-floating_002dpoint-calculations"></span>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already looked at defining and referring to complex numbers
(see <a href="Complex-Data-Types.html">Complex Data Types</a>).  What is important to discuss here are
some issues that are unlikely to be obvious to programmers without
extensive experience in both numerical computing, and in complex
arithmetic in mathematics.
</p>
<p>The first important point is that, unlike real arithmetic, in complex
arithmetic, the danger of significance loss is <em>pervasive</em>, and
affects <em>every one</em> of the basic operations, and <em>almost
all</em> of the math-library functions.  To understand why, recall the
rules for complex multiplication and division:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">a = u + I*v              /* <span class="roman">First operand.</span> */
b = x + I*y              /* <span class="roman">Second operand.</span> */

prod = a * b
     = (u + I*v) * (x + I*y)
     = (u * x - v * y) + I*(v * x + u * y)

quo  = a / b
     = (u + I*v) / (x + I*y)
     = [(u + I*v) * (x - I*y)] / [(x + I*y) * (x - I*y)]
     = [(u * x + v * y) + I*(v * x - u * y)] / (x**2 + y**2)
</pre></div>

<p>There are four critical observations about those formulas:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the multiplications on the right-hand side introduce the
possibility of premature underflow or overflow;

</li><li> the products must be accurate to twice working precision;

</li><li> there is <em>always</em> one subtraction on the right-hand sides
that is subject to catastrophic significance loss; and

</li><li> complex multiplication has up to <em>six</em> rounding errors, and
complex division has <em>ten</em> rounding errors.

</li></ul>

<span id="index-branch-cuts"></span>
<p>Another point that needs careful study is the fact that many functions
in complex arithmetic have <em>branch cuts</em>.  You can view a
function with a complex argument, <code>f (z)</code>, as <code>f (x + I*y)</code>,
and thus, it defines a relation between a point <code>(x, y)</code> on the
complex plane with an elevation value on a surface.  A branch cut
looks like a tear in that surface, so approaching the cut from one
side produces a particular value, and from the other side, a quite
different value.  Great care is needed to handle branch cuts properly,
and even small numerical errors can push a result from one side to the
other, radically changing the returned value.  As we reported earlier,
correct handling of the sign of zero is critically important for
computing near branch cuts.
</p>
<p>The best advice that we can give to programmers who need complex
arithmetic is to always use the <em>highest precision available</em>,
and then to carefully check the results of test calculations to gauge
the likely accuracy of the computed results.  It is easy to supply
test values of real and imaginary parts where all five basic
operations in complex arithmetic, and almost all of the complex math
functions, lose <em>all</em> significance, and fail to produce even a
single correct digit.
</p>
<p>Even though complex arithmetic makes some programming tasks
easier, it may be numerically preferable to rework the algorithm
so that it can be carried out in real arithmetic.  That is
commonly possible in matrix algebra.
</p>
<p>GNU C can perform code optimization on complex number multiplication and
division if certain boundary checks will not be needed.  The
command-line option <samp>-fcx-limited-range</samp> tells the compiler that
a range reduction step is not needed when performing complex division,
and that there is no need to check if a complex multiplication or
division results in the value <code>Nan + I*NaN</code>.  By default these
checks are enabled.  You can explicitly enable them with the
<samp>-fno-cx-limited-range</samp> option.
