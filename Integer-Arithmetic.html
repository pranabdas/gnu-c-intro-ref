<span id="index-integer-arithmetic"></span>

<p>Each of the basic arithmetic operations in C has two variants for
integers: <em>signed</em> and <em>unsigned</em>.  The choice is determined
by the data types of their operands.
</p>
<p>Each integer data type in C is either <em>signed</em> or <em>unsigned</em>.
A signed type can hold a range of positive and negative numbers, with
zero near the middle of the range.  An unsigned type can hold only
nonnegative numbers; its range starts with zero and runs upward.
</p>
<p>The most basic integer types are <code>int</code>, which normally can hold
numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and <code>unsigned
int</code>, which normally can hold numbers from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  (This
assumes <code>int</code> is 32 bits wide, always true for GNU C on real
computers but not always on embedded controllers.)  See <a href="Integer-Types.html">Integer Data Types</a>, for full information about integer types.
</p>
<p>When a basic arithmetic operation is given two signed operands, it
does signed arithmetic.  Given two unsigned operands, it does
unsigned arithmetic.
</p>
<p>If one operand is <code>unsigned int</code> and the other is <code>int</code>, the
operator treats them both as unsigned.  More generally, the common
type of the operands determines whether the operation is signed or
not.  See <a href="Common-Type.html">Common Type</a>.
</p>
<p>Printing the results of unsigned arithmetic with <code>printf</code> using
&lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo; can produce surprising results for values far away from
zero.  Even though the rules above say that the computation was done
with unsigned arithmetic, the printed result may appear to be signed!
</p>
<p>The explanation is that the bit pattern resulting from addition,
subtraction or multiplication is actually the same for signed and
unsigned operations.  The difference is only in the data type of the
result, which affects the <em>interpretation</em> of the result bit pattern,
and whether the arithmetic operation can overflow (see the next section).
</p>
<p>But &lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t know its argument&rsquo;s data type.  It sees only the
value&rsquo;s bit pattern, and it is defined to interpret that as
<code>signed int</code>.  To print it as unsigned requires using &lsquo;<samp>%u</samp>&rsquo;
instead of &lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo;.  See <a data-manual="libc" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Formatted-Output.html#Formatted-Output">The GNU C Library</a> in <cite>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>Arithmetic in C never operates directly on narrow integer types (those
with fewer bits than <code>int</code>; <a href="Narrow-Integers.html">Narrow Integers</a>).  Instead it
&ldquo;promotes&rdquo; them to <code>int</code>.  See <a href="Operand-Promotions.html">Operand Promotions</a>.
