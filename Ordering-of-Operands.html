<span id="index-ordering-of-operands-1"></span>
<span id="index-operand-ordering"></span>

<p>Operands and arguments can be computed in any order, but there are limits to
this intermixing in GNU C:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The operands of a binary arithmetic operator can be computed in either
order, but they can&rsquo;t be intermixed: one of them has to come first,
followed by the other.  Any side effects in the operand that&rsquo;s computed
first are executed before the other operand is computed.

</li><li> That applies to assignment operators too, except that, in simple assignment,
the previous value of the left operand is unused.

</li><li> The arguments in a function call can be computed in any order, but
they can&rsquo;t be intermixed.  Thus, one argument is fully computed, then
another, and so on until they have all been done.  Any side effects in
one argument are executed before computation of another argument
begins.
</li></ul>

<p>These rules don&rsquo;t cover side effects caused by postincrement and
postdecrement operators&mdash;those can be deferred up to the next
sequence point.
</p>
<p>If you want to get pedantic, the fact is that GCC can reorder the
computations in many other ways provided that it doesn&rsquo;t alter the result
of running the program.  However, because it doesn&rsquo;t alter the result
of running the program, it is negligible, unless you are concerned
with the values in certain variables at various times as seen by other
processes.  In those cases, you should use <code>volatile</code> to prevent
optimizations that would make them behave strangely.  See <a href="volatile.html"><code>volatile</code> Variables and Fields</a>.
