	* c.texi: fix typos.
	* fp.texi (Machine Epsilon, Rounding Control):
	Don't have text on the same line as @ignore.

2024-01-08  Richard Stallman  <rms@gnu.org>

	* c.texi (Unicode Character Codes): Rewrite the initial explanation of
	character codes and escape characters.  Define "code point".
	Use fire and water in Chinese examples.
	D800 - DFFF are not exactly invalid so say it is too obscure
	to explain here.
	(Wide String Constants): Types of wide strings are array types.
	(Type Size): Explain about side effects in sizeof expr and
	sizeof (type).
	Rename the variable `array' to `arr'.
	For size_t, don't say what kind of definition it has.
	(Pointer Types): Write "pointer to an array of".

GNU C Intro and Reference - ChangeLog

2024-01-07  Richard Stallman  <rms@gnu.org>

	* c.texi Many simple clarifiations and fixes.
	(Top): Explain we assume programs run on a real computer.
	(Iterative Fibonacci): Add footnote about how a statement with
	no side effects can be useful in special situations.
	(Complete Explanation): Fix xref node target.
	(Identifiers): GNU C allows $.
	(Operators/Punctuation): Explain each of the other punctuation chars.
	Brief note re preprocessing operators.
	How to group operator chars.
	(Shift Operations): Explain binary constants here too.
	(Shift Hacks): Explain binary constants here too.
	Delete extra 0 at end of one binary constant.
	(Bitwise Operations): Explain binary constants here too.
	(Assignment Expressions): Recommend parens around conditional exp
	inside a conditional exp.
	(Lvalues): Add item for constructors.
	Explain a little about arrays that are not lvalues.
	(Modifying Assignment): Explain better about += and side-effects
	inside subexpressions of the lvalue.
	(Conditional Rules): Use parens when nesting conditional expressions.
	(Conditional Branches): Correct type conversion rules for for branches.
	(Binary Operator Grammar): Here and elsewhere, write "operations"
	instead of "operators".
	(Associativity and Ordering): State which operations are associative.
	Explain the add-four-function-calls example in detail.
	(Signed and Unsigned Types): Expain how char relates to signed char
	and unsigned char.
	(Complex Data Types): Mention j as imaginary suffix.
	(Integer Const Type): Add examples for integer suffix U.
	(Floating Constants): Clarify that suffixes don't make a number float.
	(Floating Constants): Hex float constant must have an exponent.
	(Character Constants): Explain the traditional names a little.
	Give ryles for octal character code.
	(Pointer Dereference): Add another example of a pointer to a variable.

2023-10-09  Ineiev  <ineiev@gnu.org>

	Release 0.0.

	* configure.ac: Set release to 0.0.
	* c.texi: Cite release number.
	* version.texi (EDITION, VERSION): Use VERSION instead of EDITION;
	set to 0.0-git.
	* NEWS: Update.

2023-09-25  Ineiev  <ineiev@gnu.org>

	Add Autotools system in parallel with Makefile.

	* Makefile.am:
	* version.texi:
	* configure.ac: New files.
	* c.texi: Include version.texi.
	* Makefile: Add copyright and license notices,
	gather common dependencies in $(SOURCES), use $< and $@ in rules.
