<p>An unsigned integer type can represent only positive numbers and zero.
A signed type can represent both positive and negative number, in a
range spread almost equally on both sides of zero.  For instance,
<code>unsigned char</code> holds numbers from 0 to 255 (on most computers),
while <code>signed char</code> holds numbers from -128 to 127.  Each of
these types holds 256 different possible values, since they are both 8
bits wide.
</p>
<p>Write <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> before the type keyword to
specify a signed or an unsigned type.  However, the integer types
other than <code>char</code> are signed by default; with them, <code>signed</code>
is a no-op.
</p>
<p>Plain <code>char</code> may be signed or unsigned; this depends on the
compiler, the machine in use, and its operating system.
</p>
<p>In many programs, it makes no difference whether <code>char</code> is
signed.  When it does matter, don&rsquo;t leave it to chance; write
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>.<a id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>

<p>Personal note from
Richard Stallman: Eating with hackers at a fish restaurant, I ordered
Arctic Char.  When my meal arrived, I noted that the chef had not
signed it.  So I complained, &ldquo;This char is unsigned&mdash;I wanted a
signed char!&rdquo;  Or rather, I would have said this if I had thought of
it fast enough.</p>
