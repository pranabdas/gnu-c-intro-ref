<span id="Header-Files-1"></span><h3 class="section">26.4 Header Files</h3>

<span id="index-header-file"></span>
<p>A header file is a file of C code, typically containing C declarations
and macro definitions (see <a href="Macros.html">Macros</a>), to be shared between several
source files.  You request the use of a header file in your program by
<em>including</em> it, with the C preprocessing directive
<code>#include</code>.
</p>
<p>Header files serve two purposes.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span id="index-system-header-files"></span>
System header files declare the interfaces to parts of the operating
system.  You include them in your program to supply the definitions and
declarations that you need to invoke system calls and libraries.

</li><li> Program-specific header files contain declarations for interfaces between the
source files of a particular program.  It is a good idea to create a header
file for related declarations and macro definitions if all or most of them
are needed in several different source files.
</li></ul>

<p>Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header
file into each source file that needs it.  Such copying would be
time-consuming and error-prone.  With a header file, the related
declarations appear in only one place.  If they need to be changed, you
can change them in one place, and programs that include the header file
will then automatically use the new version when next recompiled.  The header
file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well
as the risk that a failure to change one copy will result in
inconsistencies within a program.
</p>
<p>In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with
<samp>.h</samp>.  It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and
underscores in header file names, and at most one dot.
</p>
<p>The operation of including another source file isn&rsquo;t actually limited
to the sort of code we put into header files.  You can put any sort of
C code into a separate file, then use <code>#include</code> to copy it
virtually into other C source files.  But that is a strange thing to
do.
