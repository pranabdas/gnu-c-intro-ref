<span id="index-computed-includes"></span>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to select one of several different header
files to be included into your program.  They might specify
configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating
systems, for instance.  You could do this with a series of conditionals,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#if SYSTEM_1
# include &quot;system_1.h&quot;
#elif SYSTEM_2
# include &quot;system_2.h&quot;
#elif SYSTEM_3
/* <span class="roman">&hellip;</span> */
#endif
</pre></div>

<p>That rapidly becomes tedious.  Instead, GNU C offers the ability to use
a macro for the header name.  This is called a <em>computed include</em>.
Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of
<code>#include</code>, you simply put a macro name there instead:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define SYSTEM_H &quot;system_1.h&quot;
/* <span class="roman">&hellip;</span> */
#include SYSTEM_H
</pre></div>

<p><code>SYSTEM_H</code> is expanded, then <samp>system_1.h</samp> is included as if
the <code>#include</code> had been written with that name.  <code>SYSTEM_H</code>
could be defined by your Makefile with a <samp>-D</samp> option.
</p>
<p>You must be careful when you define such a macro.  <code>#define</code>
saves tokens, not text.  GCC has no way of knowing that the macro will
be used as the argument of <code>#include</code>, so it generates ordinary
tokens, not a header name.  This is unlikely to cause problems if you
use double-quote includes, which are syntactically similar to string
constants.  If you use angle brackets, however, you may have trouble.
</p>
<p>The syntax of a computed include is actually a bit more general than the
above.  If the first non-whitespace character after <code>#include</code> is
not &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo;, then the entire line is macro-expanded
like running text would be.
</p>
<p>If the line expands to a single string constant, the contents of that
string constant are the file to be included.  Preprocessing does not
re-examine the string for embedded quotes, but neither does it process
backslash escapes in the string.  Therefore
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define HEADER &quot;a\&quot;b&quot;
#include HEADER
</pre></div>

<p>looks for a file named <samp>a\&quot;b</samp>.  Preprocessing searches for the
file according to the rules for double-quoted includes.
</p>
<p>If the line expands to a token stream beginning with a &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo; token
and including a &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; token, then the tokens between the &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo; and
the first &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; are combined to form the filename to be included.
Any whitespace between tokens is reduced to a single space; then any
space after the initial &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo; is retained, but a trailing space
before the closing &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; is ignored.  Preprocessing searches for the file
according to the rules for angle-bracket includes.
</p>
<p>In either case, if there are any tokens on the line after the file name,
an error occurs and the directive is not processed.  It is also an error
if the result of expansion does not match either of the two expected
forms.
</p>
<p>These rules are implementation-defined behavior according to the C
standard.  To minimize the risk of different compilers interpreting your
computed includes differently, we recommend you use only a single
object-like macro that expands to a string constant.  That also
makes it clear to people reading your program.
