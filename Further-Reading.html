<p>The subject of floating-point arithmetic is much more complex
than many programmers seem to think, and few books on programming
languages spend much time in that area.  In this chapter, we have
tried to expose the reader to some of the key ideas, and to warn
of easily overlooked pitfalls that can soon lead to nonsensical
results.  There are a few good references that we recommend
for further reading, and for finding other important material
about computer arithmetic:
</p>
<p>We include URLs for these references when we were given them, when
they are morally legitimate to recommend; we have omitted the URLs
that are paywalled or that require running nonfree JavaScript code in
order to function.  We hope you can find morally legitimate sites
where you can access these works.

in IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers for IEEE Floating-Point
arithmetic</cite>, IBM Journal of Research and Development <b>43</b>(5/6)
723&ndash;760 (1999), This article gives a good description of IBM&rsquo;s
algorithm for exact decimal-to-binary conversion, complementing
earlier ones by Clinger and others.

</li><li> Nelson H. F. Beebe, <cite>The Mathematical-Function Computation Handbook:
Programming Using the MathCW Portable Software Library</cite>,
Springer (2017).
This book describes portable implementations of a large superset
of the mathematical functions available in many programming
languages, extended to a future 256-bit format (70 decimal
digits), for both binary and decimal floating point.  It includes
a substantial portion of the functions described in the famous

and its companions by David Matula, address the base-conversion
problem, and show that the naive formulas are wrong by one or
two digits.

This paper has been widely distributed, and reissued in vendor
programming-language documentation.  It is well worth reading,
and then rereading from time to time.

This is the largest known bibliography of publications about
floating-point, and also integer, arithmetic.  It is actively
maintained, and in mid 2019, contains more than 6400 references to
original research papers, reports, theses, books, and Web sites on the
subject matter.  It can be used to locate the latest research in the
field, and the historical coverage dates back to a 1726 paper on
signed-digit arithmetic, and an 1837 paper by Charles Babbage, the
intellectual father of mechanical computers.  The entries for the
Abbott, Clinger, and Steele &amp; White papers cited earlier contain
pointers to several other important related papers on the
base-conversion problem.

ISBN 0-19-853614-3 (xiv + 719 pages).  Its author is the famous
chief architect of the IEEE 754 arithmetic system, and one of the
world&rsquo;s greatest experts in the field of floating-point
arithmetic.  An entire generation of his students at the
University of California, Berkeley, have gone on to careers in
academic and industry, spreading the knowledge of how to do
floating-point arithmetic right.

chapter supplies a correctness proof of the decimal to
binary, and binary to decimal, conversions in fixed-point
arithmetic in the TeX typesetting system.  The proof evaded
