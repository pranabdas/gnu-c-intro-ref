<p><em>Floating point</em> is the binary analogue of scientific notation:
internally it represents a number as a fraction and a binary exponent;
the value is that fraction multiplied by the specified power of 2.
(The C standard nominally permits other bases, but in GNU C the base
is always 2.)
</p>
<p>For instance, to represent 6, the fraction would be 0.75 and the
exponent would be 3; together they stand for the value <em class='math'>0.75 * 2<sup>3</sup></em>,
meaning 0.75 * 8.  The value 1.5 would use 0.75 as the fraction and 1
as the exponent.  The value 0.75 would use 0.75 as the fraction and 0
as the exponent.  The value 0.375 would use 0.75 as the fraction and
-1 as the exponent.
</p>
<p>These binary exponents are used by machine instructions.  You can
write a floating-point constant this way if you wish, using
hexadecimal; but normally we write floating-point numbers in decimal (base 10).
See <a href="Floating-Constants.html">Floating-Point Constants</a>.
</p>
<p>C has three floating-point data types:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><code>double</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>&ldquo;Double-precision&rdquo; floating point, which uses 64 bits.  This is the
normal floating-point type, and modern computers normally do
their floating-point computations in this type, or some wider type.
Except when there is a special reason to do otherwise, this is the
type to use for floating-point values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>float</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>&ldquo;Single-precision&rdquo; floating point, which uses 32 bits.  It is useful
for floating-point values stored in structures and arrays, to save
space when the full precision of <code>double</code> is not needed.  In
addition, single-precision arithmetic is faster on some computers, and
occasionally that is useful.  But not often&mdash;most programs don&rsquo;t use
the type <code>float</code>.
</p>
<p>C would be cleaner if <code>float</code> were the name of the type we
use for most floating-point values; however, for historical reasons,
that&rsquo;s not so.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>long double</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>&ldquo;Extended-precision&rdquo; floating point is either 80-bit or 128-bit
precision, depending on the machine in use.  On some machines, which
have no floating-point format wider than <code>double</code>, this is
equivalent to <code>double</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Floating-point arithmetic raises many subtle issues.  See <a href="Floating-Point-in-Depth.html">Floating Point in Depth</a>, for more information.
