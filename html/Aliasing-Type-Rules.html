<span id="Type-Rules-for-Aliasing"></span><h3 class="appendixsection">B.3 Type Rules for Aliasing</h3>

<p>C code that converts a pointer to a different pointer type can use the
pointers to access the same memory locations with two different data
types.  If the same address is accessed with different types in a
single control thread, optimization can make the code do surprising
things (in effect, make it malfunction).
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a concrete example where aliasing that can change the code&rsquo;s
behavior when it is optimized.  We assume that <code>float</code> is 4 bytes
long, like <code>int</code>, and so is every pointer.  Thus, the structures
<code>struct a</code> and <code>struct b</code> are both 8 bytes.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
struct a { int size; char *data; };
struct b { float size; char *data; };

void sub (struct a *p, struct b *q)
{
  int x;
  p-&gt;size = 0;
  q-&gt;size = 1;
  x = p-&gt;size;
  printf(&quot;x       =%d\n&quot;, x);
  printf(&quot;p-&gt;size =%d\n&quot;, (int)p-&gt;size);
  printf(&quot;q-&gt;size =%d\n&quot;, (int)q-&gt;size);
}

int main(void)
{
  struct a foo;
  struct a *p = &amp;foo;
  struct b *q = (struct b *) &amp;foo;

  sub (p, q);
}
</pre></div>

<p>This code works as intended when compiled without optimization.  All
the operations are carried out sequentially as written.  The code
sets <code>x</code> to <code>p-&gt;size</code>, but what it actually gets is the
bits of the floating point number 1, as type <code>int</code>.
</p>
<p>However, when optimizing, the compiler is allowed to assume
(mistakenly, here) that <code>q</code> does not point to the same storage as
<code>p</code>, because their data types are not allowed to alias.
</p>
<p>From this assumption, the compiler can deduce (falsely, here) that the
assignment into <code>q-&gt;size</code> has no effect on the value of
<code>p-&gt;size</code>, which must therefore still be 0.  Thus, <code>x</code> will
be set to 0.
</p>
<p>GNU C, following the C standard, <em>defines</em> this optimization as
legitimate.  Code that misbehaves when optimized following these rules
is, by definition, incorrect C code.
</p>
<p>The rules for storage aliasing in C are based on the two data types:
the type of the object, and the type it is accessed through.  The
rules permit accessing part of a storage object of type <var>t</var> using
only these types:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <var>t</var>.

</li><li> A type compatible with <var>t</var>.  See <a href="Compatible-Types.html">Compatible Types</a>.

</li><li> A signed or unsigned version of one of the above.

</li><li> A qualified version of one of the above.
See <a href="Type-Qualifiers.html">Type Qualifiers</a>.

</li><li> An array, structure (see <a href="Structures.html">Structures</a>), or union type
(<code>Unions</code>) that contains one of the above, either directly as a
field or through multiple levels of fields.  If <var>t</var> is
<code>double</code>, this would include <code>struct s { union { double
d[2]; int i[4]; } u; int i; };</code> because there&rsquo;s a <code>double</code>
inside it somewhere.

</li><li> A character type.
</li></ul>

<p>What do these rules say about the example in this subsection?
</p>
<p>For <code>foo.size</code> (equivalently, <code>a-&gt;size</code>), <var>t</var> is
<code>int</code>.  The type <code>float</code> is not allowed as an aliasing type
by those rules, so <code>b-&gt;size</code> is not supposed to alias with
elements of <code>j</code>.  Based on that assumption, GNU C makes a
permitted optimization that was not, in this case, consistent with
what the programmer intended the program to do.
</p>
<p>Whether GCC actually performs type-based aliasing analysis depends on
the details of the code.  GCC has other ways to determine (in some cases)
whether objects alias, and if it gets a reliable answer that way, it won&rsquo;t
fall back on type-based heuristics.
</p>
<p>The importance of knowing the type-based aliasing rules is not so as
to ensure that the optimization is done where it would be safe, but so
as to ensure it is <em>not</em> done in a way that would break the
program.  You can turn off type-based aliasing analysis by giving GCC
the option <samp>-fno-strict-aliasing</samp>.
