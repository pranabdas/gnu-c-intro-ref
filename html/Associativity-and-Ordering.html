<span id="index-associativity-and-ordering"></span>

<p>An associative binary operator, such as <code>+</code>, when used repeatedly
can combine any number of operands.  The operands&rsquo; values may be
computed in any order.
</p>
<p>If the values are integers and overflow can be ignored, they may be
combined in any order.  Thus, given four functions that return
<code>unsigned int</code>, calling them and adding their results as here
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(foo () + bar ()) + (baz () + quux ())
</pre></div>

<p>may add up the results in any order.
</p>
<p>By contrast, arithmetic on signed integers, in which overflow is significant,
is not always associative (see <a href="Integer-Overflow.html">Integer Overflow</a>).  Thus, the
additions must be done in the order specified, obeying parentheses and
left-association.  That means computing <code>(foo () + bar ())</code> and
<code>(baz () + quux ())</code> first (in either order), then adding the
two.
</p>
<p>The same applies to arithmetic on floating-point values, since that
too is not really associative.  However, the GCC option
<samp>-funsafe-math-optimizations</samp> allows the compiler to change the
order of calculation when an associative operation (associative in
exact mathematics) combines several operands.  The option takes effect
when compiling a module (see <a href="Compilation.html">Compilation</a>).  Changing the order
of association can enable the program to pipeline the floating point
operations.
</p>
<p>In all these cases, the four function calls can be done in any order.
There is no right or wrong about that.
