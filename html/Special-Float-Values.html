<p>IEEE floating point provides for special values that are not ordinary
numbers.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>infinities</span></dt>
<dd><p><code>+Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code> are two different infinite
values, one positive and one negative.  These result from
operations such as <code>1 / 0</code>, <code>Infinity + Infinity</code>,
<code>Infinity * Infinity</code>, and <code>Infinity + <var>finite</var></code>, and also
from a result that is finite, but larger than the most positive possible
value or smaller than the most negative possible value.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Handling-Infinity.html">Handling Infinity</a>, for more about working with infinities.

<dt id='index-QNaN'><span>NaNs (not a number)<a href='#index-QNaN' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><span id="index-SNaN"></span>
<p>There are two special values, called Not-a-Number (NaN): a quiet
NaN (QNaN), and a signaling NaN (SNaN).
</p>
<p>A QNaN is produced by operations for which the value is undefined
in real arithmetic, such as <code>0 / 0</code>, <code>sqrt (-1)</code>,
<code>Infinity - Infinity</code>, and any basic operation in which an
operand is a QNaN.
</p>
<p>The signaling NaN is intended for initializing
otherwise-unassigned storage, and the goal is that unlike a
QNaN, an SNaN <em>does</em> cause an interrupt that can be caught
by a software handler, diagnosed, and reported.  In practice,
little use has been made of signaling NaNs, because the most
common CPUs in desktop and portable computers fail to implement
the full IEEE 754 Standard, and supply only one kind of NaN, the
quiet one.  Also, programming-language standards have taken
decades to catch up to the IEEE 754 standard, and implementations
of those language standards make an additional delay before
programmers become willing to use these features.
</p>
<p>To enable support for signaling NaNs, use the GCC command-line option
<samp>-fsignaling-nans</samp>, but this is an experimental feature and may
not work as expected in every situation.
</p>
<p>A NaN has a sign bit, but its value means nothing.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Handling-NaN.html">Handling NaN</a>, for more about working with NaNs.

<dd><span id="index-underflow_002c-floating"></span>
<span id="index-floating-underflow"></span>
<span id="subnormal-numbers"></span><p>It can happen that a computed floating-point value is too small to
represent, such as when two tiny numbers are multiplied.  The result
is then said to <em>underflow</em>.  The traditional behavior before
the IEEE 754 Standard was to use zero as the result, and possibly to report
the underflow in some sort of program output.
</p>
<p>The IEEE 754 Standard is vague about whether rounding happens
before detection of floating underflow and overflow, or after, and CPU
designers may choose either.
</p>
<p>However, the Standard does something unusual compared to earlier
designs, and that is that when the result is smaller than the
smallest <em>normalized</em> representable value (i.e., one in
which the leading significand bit is <code>1</code>), the normalization
requirement is relaxed, leading zero bits are permitted, and
precision is gradually lost until there are no more bits in the
significand.  That phenomenon is called <em>gradual underflow</em>,
and it serves important numerical purposes, although it does
reduce the precision of the final result.  Some floating-point
designs allow you to choose at compile time, or even at
run time, whether underflows are gradual, or are flushed abruptly
to zero.  Numbers that have entered the region of gradual
underflow are called <em>subnormal</em>.
</p>
<p>You can use the library functions <code>fesetround</code> and
<code>fegetround</code> to set and get the rounding mode.  Rounding modes
are defined (if supported by the platform) in <code>fenv.h</code> as:
<code>FE_UPWARD</code> to round toward positive infinity; <code>FE_DOWNWARD</code>
to round toward negative infinity; <code>FE_TOWARDZERO</code> to round
toward zero; and <code>FE_TONEAREST</code> to round to the nearest
representable value, the default mode.  It is best to use
<code>FE_TONEAREST</code> except when there is a special need for some other
mode.
