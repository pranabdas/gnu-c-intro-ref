<p>Code for device drivers and other communication with low-level
hardware sometimes needs to be concerned with the alignment of
data objects in memory.
</p>
<p>Each data type has a required <em>alignment</em>, always a power of 2,
that says at which memory addresses an object of that type can validly
start.  A valid address for the type must be a multiple of its
alignment.  If a type&rsquo;s alignment is 1, that means it can validly
start at any address.  If a type&rsquo;s alignment is 2, that means it can
only start at an even address.  If a type&rsquo;s alignment is 4, that means
it can only start at an address that is a multiple of 4.
</p>
<p>The alignment of a type (except <code>char</code>) can vary depending on the
kind of computer in use.  To refer to the alignment of a type in a C
program, use <code>_Alignof</code>, whose syntax parallels that of
<code>sizeof</code>.  Like <code>sizeof</code>, <code>_Alignof</code> is a compile-time
operation, and it doesn&rsquo;t compute the value of the expression used
as its argument.
</p>
<p>Nominally, each integer and floating-point type has an alignment equal to
the largest power of 2 that divides its size.  Thus, <code>int</code> with
size 4 has a nominal alignment of 4, and <code>long long int</code> with
size 8 has a nominal alignment of 8.
</p>
<p>However, each kind of computer generally has a maximum alignment, and
no type needs more alignment than that.  If the computer&rsquo;s maximum
alignment is 4 (which is common), then no type&rsquo;s alignment is more
than 4.
</p>
<p>The size of any type is always a multiple of its alignment; that way,
in an array whose elements have that type, all the elements are
properly aligned if the first one is.
</p>
<p>These rules apply to all real computers today, but some embedded
controllers have odd exceptions.  We don&rsquo;t have references to cite for
them.
</p>
<p>Ordinary C code guarantees that every object of a given type is in
fact aligned as that type requires.
</p>
<p>If the operand of <code>_Alignof</code> is a structure field, the value
is the alignment it requires.  It may have a greater alignment by
coincidence, due to the other fields, but <code>_Alignof</code> is not
concerned about that.  See <a href="Structures.html">Structures</a>.
</p>
<p>Older versions of GNU C used the keyword <code>__alignof__</code> for this,
but now that the feature has been standardized, it is better
to use the standard keyword <code>_Alignof</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-_005fAlignas"></span>
<span id="index-_005f_005faligned_005f_005f"></span>
<p>You can explicitly specify an alignment requirement for a particular
variable or structure field by adding <code>_Alignas
(<var>alignment</var>)</code> to the declaration, where <var>alignment</var> is a
power of 2 or a type name.  For instance:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">char _Alignas (8) x;
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">char _Alignas (double) x;
</pre></div>

<p>specifies that <code>x</code> must start on an address that is a multiple of
8.  However, if <var>alignment</var> exceeds the maximum alignment for the
machine, that maximum is how much alignment <code>x</code> will get.
</p>
<p>The older GNU C syntax for this feature looked like
<code>__attribute__ ((__aligned__ (<var>alignment</var>)))</code> to the
declaration, and was added after the variable.  For instance:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">char x __attribute__ ((__aligned__ 8));
</pre></div>
