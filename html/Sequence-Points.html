<span id="Sequence-Points-1"></span><h3 class="section">10.3 Sequence Points</h3>
<span id="index-sequence-points"></span>
<span id="index-full-expression"></span>

<p>There are some points in the code where C makes limited guarantees
about the order of operations.  These are called <em>sequence
points</em>.  Here is where they occur:
</p>
<ul>
<li> At the end of a <em>full expression</em>; that is to say, an expression
that is not part of a larger expression.  All side effects specified
by that expression are carried out before execution moves
on to subsequent code.

</li><li> At the end of the first operand of certain operators: &lsquo;<samp>,</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>||</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>?:</samp>&rsquo;.  All side effects specified by
that expression are carried out before any execution of the
next operand.

<p>The commas that separate arguments in a function call are <em>not</em>
comma operators, and they do not create sequence points.  The rule
for function arguments and the rule for operands are different
(see <a href="Ordering-of-Operands.html">Ordering of Operands</a>).
</p>
</li><li> Just before calling a function.  All side effects specified by the
argument expressions are carried out before calling the function.

<p>If the function to be called is not constant&mdash;that is, if it is
computed by an expression&mdash;all side effects in that expression are
carried out before calling the function.
</p></li></ul>

<p>The ordering imposed by a sequence point applies locally to a limited
range of code, as stated above in each case.  For instance, the
ordering imposed by the comma operator does not apply to code outside
the operands of that comma operator.  Thus, in this code,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(x = 5, foo (x)) + x * x
</pre></div>

<p>the sequence point of the comma operator orders <code>x = 5</code> before
<code>foo (x)</code>, but <code>x * x</code> could be computed before or after
them.
