<span id="Unions-1"></span><h3 class="section">15.14 Unions</h3>
<span id="index-unions"></span>
<span id="index-union"></span>

<p>A <em>union type</em> defines alternative ways of looking at the same
piece of memory.  Each alternative view is defined with a data type,
and identified by a name.  A union definition looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">union <var>name</var>
{
  <var>alternative declarations</var><span class="roman">&hellip;</span>
};
</pre></div>

<p>Each alternative declaration looks like a structure field declaration,
except that it can&rsquo;t be a bit field.  For instance,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">union number
{
  long int integer;
  double float;
}
</pre></div>

<p>lets you store either an integer (type <code>long int</code>) or a floating
point number (type <code>double</code>) in the same place in memory.  The
length and alignment of the union type are the maximum of all the
alternatives&mdash;they do not have to be the same.  In this union
example, <code>double</code> probably takes more space than <code>long int</code>,
but that doesn&rsquo;t cause a problem in programs that use the union in the
normal way.
</p>
<p>The members don&rsquo;t have to be different in data type.  Sometimes
each member pertains to a way the data will be used.  For instance,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">union datum
{
  double latitude;
  double longitude;
  double height;
  double weight;
  int continent;
}
</pre></div>

<p>This union holds one of several kinds of data; most kinds are floating
points, but the value can also be a code for a continent which is an
integer.  You <em>could</em> use one member of type <code>double</code> to
access all the values which have that type, but the different member
names will make the program clearer.
</p>
<p>The alignment of a union type is the maximum of the alignments of the
alternatives.  The size of the union type is the maximum of the sizes
of the alternatives, rounded up to a multiple of the alignment
(because every type&rsquo;s size must be a multiple of its alignment).
</p>
<p>All the union alternatives start at the address of the union itself.
If an alternative is shorter than the union as a whole, it occupies
the first part of the union&rsquo;s storage, leaving the last part unused
<em>for that alternative</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> if the code stores data using one union alternative
and accesses it with another, the results depend on the kind of
computer in use.  Only wizards should try to do this.  However, when
you need to do this, a union is a clean way to do it.
</p>
<p>Assignment works on any union type by copying the entire value.
