<p>It is often useful to merge two tokens into one while expanding macros.
This is called <em>token pasting</em> or <em>token concatenation</em>.  The
<code>##</code> preprocessing operator performs token pasting.  When a macro
is expanded, the two tokens on either side of each <code>##</code> operator
are combined into a single token, which then replaces the <code>##</code> and
the two original tokens in the macro expansion.  Usually both will be
identifiers, or one will be an identifier and the other a preprocessing
number.  When pasted, they make a longer identifier.
</p>
<p>Concatenation into an identifier isn&rsquo;t the only valid case.  It is
also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a number and a name, such
as <code>1.5</code> and <code>e3</code>) into a number.  Also, multi-character
operators such as <code>+=</code> can be formed by token pasting.
</p>
<p>However, two tokens that don&rsquo;t together form a valid token cannot be
pasted together.  For example, you cannot concatenate <code>x</code> with
<code>+</code>, not in either order.  Trying this issues a warning and keeps
the two tokens separate.  Whether it puts white space between the
tokens is undefined.  It is common to find unnecessary uses of
<code>##</code> in complex macros.  If you get this warning, it is likely
that you can simply remove the <code>##</code>.
</p>
<p>The tokens combined by <code>##</code> could both come from the macro body,
but then you could just as well write them as one token in the first place.
Token pasting is useful when one or both of the tokens comes from a
macro argument.  If either of the tokens next to an <code>##</code> is a
parameter name, it is replaced by its actual argument before <code>##</code>
executes.  As with stringification, the actual argument is not
macro-expanded first.  If the argument is empty, that <code>##</code> has no
effect.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that preprocessing converts comments to whitespace before
it looks for uses of macros.  Therefore, you cannot create a comment
by concatenating &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;.  You can put as much
whitespace between <code>##</code> and its operands as you like, including
comments, and you can put comments in arguments that will be
concatenated.
</p>
<p>It is an error to use <code>##</code> at the beginning or end of a macro
body.
</p>
<p>Multiple <code>##</code> operators are handled left-to-right, so that
&lsquo;<samp>1 ## e ## -2</samp>&rsquo; pastes into &lsquo;<samp>1e-2</samp>&rsquo;.  (Right-to-left
processing would first generate &lsquo;<samp>e-2</samp>&rsquo;, which is an invalid token.)
When <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> are used together, they are all handled
left-to-right.
</p>
<p>Consider a C program that interprets named commands.  There probably
needs to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures declared
as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct command
{
  char *name;
  void (*function) (void);
};
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">struct command commands[] =
{
  { &quot;quit&quot;, quit_command },
  { &quot;help&quot;, help_command },
  /* <span class="roman">&hellip;</span> */
};
</pre></div>

<p>It would be cleaner not to have to write each command name twice, once
in the string constant and once in the function name.  A macro that
takes the name of a command as an argument can make this unnecessary.
It can create the string constant with stringification, and the
function name by concatenating the argument with &lsquo;<samp>_command</samp>&rsquo;.
Here is how it is done:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }

struct command commands[] =
{
  COMMAND (quit),
  COMMAND (help),
  /* <span class="roman">&hellip;</span> */
};
</pre></div>
